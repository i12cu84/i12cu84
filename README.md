### Welcome to the homepage 👋

👋 Hi, I' m [@i12cu84](https://github.com/i12cu84), graduated from Some Royal Institute of Technology.

🏆 Have won the provincial first prize in mathematical modeling. [Old-Papaer](https://github.com/i12cu84/Mathematical-Modeling-Python) and [New-Paper](https://github.com/i12cu84/Financial-Credit-Analysis-Graduation-Project-Python).

🎯 I've been obsessed with programming since junior high school, in the end chose U+([Notes](https://github.com/i12cu84/Unreal_Engine_Develop_Notes) / [Libraries](https://github.com/i12cu84/Blueprint-Function-Libraries-from-mine) / [Plugins](https://github.com/i12cu84/Add-Tag-plugins-for-Unreal-Engine-Cpp)).

🖊️ I've dabbled in a lot of fields so far, you can see [the previous notes](https://github.com/i12cu84/I12cu84-Learn-Notes) I uploaded.

📞 You can contact me by [e-mail](i12cu84@foxmail.com) or [Tencent-QQ](https://wpa.qq.com/msgrd?v=3&uin=631061931&site=qq&menu=yes&jumpflag=1). If I can help you.

### Welcome to the homepage 👋

👋 Hi, I' m @i12cu84(I want to see you ate for ... :> ). Real name is yuran, from China WenZhou, live in ChengDu now.

📚 Graduated from the Mathematics Department of CC Royal University of Technology in 2022.

🏆 Have won the provincial first prize in mathematical modeling. Energy is limited, so stop here...

🔍️ About me ...

🎯 I've been obsessed with programming since junior high school, in the end chose U++(Unreal Engine and C++)

🖊️ I've dabbled in a lot of fields so far, you can see the previous notes I uploaded, well organized and not maintaining it.

🤗 By now, I've covered a lot of languages (including but not limited to c++,python,matlab,lua,Unity-C#,java,R,u++,html,css,markdwon,latex and more)

🤔 Due to mathematics background, also know some other fields (graphics,networks,systems,shader,data structures and algorithms,numerical analysis and more)

🤫 Can't chew too much. I don't think I'm that good. Learning is a long process.

🤭 Of course ...

🎮 I used to be an unknown professional gamer, it was an unforgettable time for me....

💻 After retirement mainly play Honor of Kings[Country area]. Even though I'm getting worse, but that doesn't stop me from having pleasure.

🤝 I accept all technical support and communication, and don't forget to invite me to play games!

📞 You can contact me by e-mail: i12cu84@foxmail.com. If I can help you.

P.S.-1: There are a lot of treasure in my library, oh, I hope to help you, if you don't dislike it, please collect it, this is not a small encouragement to me, thank you!

P.S.0: My English is not very good. I'm sorry that most of my notes are in Chinese. If possible, I will try to express some key content in English.

P.S.1: I'm focusing on U++ right now and probably won't delve into anything else, but I can get up to speed quickly and love to learn.

P.S.2: MBTI is an ISFJ, wish I knew you.
