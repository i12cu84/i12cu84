### Welcome to the homepage 👋

👋 Hi, I' m @i12cu84(I want to see you ete for). Real name is 彧然, from China WenZhou, live in Chengdu now.

📚 Graduated from the Mathematics Department of CC Royal University of Technology in 2022.

🏆 Have won the provincial first prize in mathematical modeling. Energy is limited, so stop here...

🔍️ About...

🎯 I've been obsessed with programming since junior high school, in the end chose U++(Unreal Engine and C++)

🖊️ I've dabbled in a lot of fields so far, you can see the previous notes I uploaded, well organized and not maintaining it.

🤗 By now, I've covered a lot of languages (including but not limited to c++,python,matlab,lua,Unity-C#,java,R,u++,html,css,markdwon,latex and more)

🤔 Due to mathematics background, also know some other fields (graphics,networks,systems,shader,data structures and algorithms,numerical analysis and more)

🤫 Of course, can't chew too much. I don't think I'm that good. Learning is a long process.

🤭 Sure...

🎮 I AM A BIG GAMER, used to play professionally,but I'm getting weak....

💻 After retirement mainly play Honor of Kings[Country area]. Even though I'm getting worse, but that doesn't stop me from having pleasure.

🤝 I accept all technical support and communication, and don't forget to invite me to play games!

📞 You can contact me by e-mail: 631061931@qq.com. Of course, my qq number is also 631061931.

P.S.1: My English is not very good. I'm sorry that most of my notes are in Chinese. If possible, I will try to express some key content in English.

P.S.2: I'm focusing on U++ right now and probably won't delve into anything else, but I can get up to speed quickly and love to learn.

P.S.3: MBTI ISFJ, wish I knew you.
